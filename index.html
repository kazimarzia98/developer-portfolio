                  But believe it or not, there are some pretty epic things that come out of that discomfort. Like the elimination of fear and the permission to be yourself. And from that, flattering photos that still LOOK and FEEL like you.
                  
                  And that… That gift of seeing yourself reflected in your photos – of just letting go and being​​​​​​​ 100% confident in who you are – is my ultimate purpose as a wedding photographer.</p>
